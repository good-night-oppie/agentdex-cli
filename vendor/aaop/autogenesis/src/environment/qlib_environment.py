_EXPRESSION_RULES = """  Only the following operations are allowed in expressions: 
  ### **Cross-sectional Functions**

  - **TS_QUANTILE(A, p, q)**: Rolling quantile of sequence A over the past p periods, where q is the quantile value between 0 and 1.
  - **TS_STD(A, n)**: Standard deviation of sequence A over the past n days.
  - **TS_VAR(A, p)**: Rolling variance of sequence A over the past p periods.
  - **TS_CORR(A, B, n)**: Correlation coefficient between sequences A and B over the past n days.
  - **TS_COVARIANCE(A, B, n)**: Covariance between sequences A and B over the past n days.
  - **TS_MAD(A, n)**: Rolling Median Absolute Deviation of sequence A over the past n days.
  - **PERCENTILE(A, q, p)**: Quantile of sequence A, where q is the quantile value between 0 and 1. If p is provided, it calculates the rolling quantile over the past p periods.
  - **HIGHDAY(A, n)**: Number of days since the highest value of A in the past n days.
  - **LOWDAY(A, n)**: Number of days since the lowest value of A in the past n days.
  - **SUMAC(A, n)**: Cumulative sum of A over the past n days.

  ### **Moving Averages and Smoothing Functions**
  - **SMA(A, n, m)**: Simple moving average of A over n periods with modifier m.
  - **WMA(A, n)**: Weighted moving average of A over n periods, with weights decreasing from 0.9 to 0.9^(n).
  - **EMA(A, n)**: Exponential moving average of A over n periods, where the decay factor is 2/(n+1).
  - **DECAYLINEAR(A, d)**: Linearly weighted moving average of A over d periods, with weights increasing from 1 to d.

  ### **Mathematical Operations**
  - **PROD(A, n)**: Product of values in A over the past n days. Use `*` for general multiplication.
  - **LOG(A)**: Natural logarithm of each element in A.
  - **SQRT(A)**: Square root of each element in A.
  - **POW(A, n)**: Raise each element in A to the power of n.

  - **FLOOR(A)**: Floor of each element in sequence A.
  
  ### **Conditional and Logical Functions**
  - **COUNT(C, n)**: Count of samples satisfying condition C in the past n periods. Here, C is a logical expression, e.g., `$close > $open`.
  - **SUMIF(A, n, C)**: Sum of A over the past n periods if condition C is met. Here, C is a logical expression.
  - **FILTER(A, C)**: Filtering multi-column sequence A based on condition C. Here, C is presented in a logical expression form, with the same size as A.
  - **(C1)&&(C2)**: Logical operation "and". Both C1 and C2 are logical expressions, such as A > B.
  - **(C1)||(C2)**: Logical operation "or". Both C1 and C2 are logical expressions, such as A > B.
  - **(C1)?(A):(B)**: Logical operation "If condition C1 holds, then A, otherwise B". C1 is a logical expression, such as A > B.

  ### **Regression and Residual Functions**
  - **SEQUENCE(n)**: A single-column sequence of length n, ranging from 1 to integer n. `SEQUENCE()` should always be nested in `REGBETA()` or `REGRESI()` as argument B.
  - **REGBETA(A, B, n)**: Regression coefficient of A on B using the past n samples, where A MUST be a multi-column sequence and B a single-column or multi-column sequence.
  - **REGRESI(A, B, n)**: Residual of regression of A on B using the past n samples, where A MUST be a multi-column sequence and B a single-column or multi-column sequence.

  ### **Technical Indicators**
  - **RSI(A, n)**: Relative Strength Index of sequence A over n periods. Measures momentum by comparing the magnitude of recent gains to recent losses.
  - **MACD(A, short_window, long_window)**: Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) of sequence A, calculated as the difference between the short-term (short_window) and long-term (long_window) exponential moving averages.
  - **BB_MIDDLE(A, n)**: Middle Bollinger Band, calculated as the n-period simple moving average of sequence A.
  - **BB_UPPER(A, n)**: Upper Bollinger Band, calculated as middle band plus two standard deviations of sequence A over n periods.
  - **BB_LOWER(A, n)**: Lower Bollinger Band, calculated as middle band minus two standard deviations of sequence A over n periods.


  Note that:
  - Only the variables provided in data (e.g., `$open`), arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /`), logical operators (`&&, ||`), and the operations above are allowed in the factor expression.
  - Make sure your factor expression contain at least one variables within the dataframe columns (e.g. $open), combined with registered operations above. Do NOT use any undeclared variable (e.g. 'n', 'w_1') and undefined symbols (e.g., '=') in the expression. 
  - Pay attention to the distinction between operations with the TS prefix (e.g., `TS_STD()`) and those without (e.g., `STD()`).
